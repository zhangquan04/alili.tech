            var html = "\n\n            \x3cp\x3e[\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/www.cleveroad.com\/images\/logo.svg\x22 alt=\x22Logo\x22\x3e][1]\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3ch1\x3eVue.js vs React.js: Can Any Of Two Frameworks Lead In UI Development?\x3c\/h1\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eHow do we create a front-end? There are many ways to do it, especially considering such a large number of programming languages. The best way to find out it is to test all frameworks on your own. That is what our developers do to find something really applicable in one case or another. And nowadays libraries like React.js and Vue.js are some of the most popular tools for websites [front-end building][22].\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eWe would like to discuss some pros and cons of both of these frameworks and compare them. What are they and why developers use them? Let\x27s check it out.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3ch2\x3eVue or React - what are they?\x3c\/h2\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eSo, React.js and Vue.js. They are really worth the attention we pay to them. They are very popular JavaScript libraries among all software developers in the world. You can simply check the list of popular languages on the [official website][23] for JS developers.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBoth these frameworks have really impressive capabilities and they are used for the development of user interfaces. It is rather easy to work with them, the main thing is to understand what is what, and what is the right step. Using \x3cstrong\x3eReact or Vue,\x3c\/strong\x3e we can do this step and create a really impressive front-end.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eIt may seem that these libraries are very similar. Indeed, they serve the same purpose. And these are not the only similarities. In particular, Vue.js documentation has a section where other frameworks are listed and compared. And the comparison to React doesn\x27t rank last place in this documentation. Because React is a serious competitor to \x3cstrong\x3eVue and\x3c\/strong\x3e \x3cstrong\x3eReact.js advantages\x3c\/strong\x3e can be really weighty. So we will speak about the differences and similarities in our opinion concerning all practical working aspects.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3ch2\x3eWhat do these JavaScript frameworks have in common?\x3c\/h2\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eFirst, it would be better to mention what similarities our frameworks have.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eThey have the following features in common:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eBoth of them use \x3cstrong\x3eVirtual DOM (Document Object Model)\x3c\/strong\x3e;\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eThey provide users with reactivity and component structure; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eThey focus on root library, and other issues like routing or app condition management are allocated to additional libraries.  \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eThese are just some of main similarities but it is not the full list. But we could say with certainty that React is actively surpassing Vue in an abundance of the ecosystem and a large number of available user renderers. \x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eAlso, using React Native, web app can be built more easily. We will speak about this technology in a detail below. \x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eDo you know what is the most important phrase every programmer should know how to display in the form of code? It is \x27Hello, World\x27. This phrase is used by young developers that write their first software. So we will check now how React and Vue differ from each other in code form when displaying \x27Hello World\x27.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eHello World from React:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/www.cleveroad.com\/images\/article-previews\/Hello-World-React-1.png\x22 alt=\x22reactjs vuejs\x22 title=\x22See the code in Hello World phrase written in React\x22\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eHello World from React\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eHello World from Vue:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/www.cleveroad.com\/images\/article-previews\/Hello-Vue.png\x22 alt=\x22why use vue js\x22 title=\x22See the Hello World from Vue\x22\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eHello from Vue\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eIn this example, we can see that when using Vue one script allows us to make this code a bit simpler. But it doesn\x27t mean that Vue is better at everything. Both frameworks have some positive and negative that we would like to accentuate in our article.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3ch2\x3eWhat is better: Vue.js advantages and benefits of using React.js\x3c\/h2\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eNow it is the time to start comparing. What should we use in one case or another?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e#1. Need an app with templates? Vue is up to you\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eVue attributes should be added to HTML layout - it is a necessary action. It may remind a data-binding feature in Angular library, and directives are targeted for adding functionality on the page. Let\x27s imagine an example of a simple \x3cstrong\x3eVue app\x3c\/strong\x3e that displays a message and contains a button name of which can be changed to the opposite by clicking.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eThis process can be implemented much faster due to Vue.js template. In the case of React, it avoids templates and it requires from the developer to activate DOM in JavaScript that is automated with JSX. So the same app will require more actions from the user.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/www.cleveroad.com\/images\/article-previews\/vue-template-1.png\x22 alt=\x22vue js sample\x22 title=\x22Vue template in Visual Studio\x22\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eWorking with Vue template \x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eIf you want to use templates, you will have to learn advanced HTML. But if you need to write simple functions, standard HTML and JavaScript can be enough. Moreover, the advantage of the creation of functions lies in the easier testing process as well.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eHowever, in the second release of Vue, you can use both templates and create functions.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e#2. Don\x27t want to complicate things? Choose a Vue\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eA simple app written using Vue can be uploaded from the browser directly without a transpilation. It allows the user to add Vue library to the project easily, like jQuery.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eYou can do it in React library as well, but more often React-written code is based on JSX and ES more.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eVue.js examples\x27simplicity is reflected in its design. We can compare how two frameworks can process value in the app.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eReact compares current and previous value - it makes it possible for React to understand when and what to add to DOM. That is the reason why it is impossible to change the value directly.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eAs for Vue, all data is changed there without any troubles. It may seem that the Vue rendering process lacks React efficiency, but it is not correct. Vue is constantly monitoring DOM conditions and automatically changes values once it is changed. So this process in Vue is not only more capacious but also more efficient comparing to React.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eHowever, everything is not so shiny concerning Vue. Vue cannot monitor editing of values, their deletion, and other massive changes. These shortcomings can be eliminated using React set-methods. So it can give a notion of \x3cstrong\x3ewhat is Vue.js\x3c\/strong\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e#3. Need a small and fast app? Vue is waiting for you\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBoth React and Vue create virtual DOM and sync it to a real DOM once data inside is changed. Both libraries have tools for the optimization of this process.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eVue developers tried to make Vue\x27s rendering system faster than that one of React\x27s. As for library size, Vue gains the lead here. The last release of \x3cstrong\x3eVue framework\x3c\/strong\x3e is minimized up to 25.6 kb.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBut if you want to get all React tools, you will have to download \x3cstrong\x3eReact DOM\x3c\/strong\x3e (37,4 kb), \x3cstrong\x3eReact library\x3c\/strong\x3e (11.4 kb), and now it is two times heavier than Vue. At the same time, you will get more \x3cstrong\x3eAPIs\x3c\/strong\x3e from React.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e#4. Need a large app? React is at your disposal\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eComparing simple apps developed on the basis of React and Vue, the majority of developers can give their preference to Vue. It is because apps that are created using templates can be developed more easily.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBut these benefits can slow down the development process if the app will increase in sizes. App templates are subject to bugs in the process of the implementation of specific tasks, and it is not easy to restructure and divide this app into components. So when you think about a large web app, \x3cstrong\x3ecreate React app.\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBut JS templates can be structured to components and they have a clean reusable code. Testing of the app is implemented more quickly as well.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/www.cleveroad.com\/images\/article-previews\/table-1.png\x22 alt=\x22vue js react\x22 title=\x22See detailed info about React and Vue\x22\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eHistory of React.js and Vue.js\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eSo, React is advantageous in large apps when readability and possibility to test code are crucial.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e#5. Looking for a library for your web or mobile app development? You need a React.\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eReact Native is a library that helps to develop mobile apps in JavaScript language. It is almost the same as React.js, but there are native components, not the web. If a developer had an experience of working with React.js, it wouldn\x27t be a problem for him to learn React Native.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eIt is very important that it can build an app for web or mobile without additional skills and tools. Learning React gives the developer an undisputed advantage if he or she plans to develop both web and mobile apps. Now do you see \x3cstrong\x3ewhy use React.js\x3c\/strong\x3e?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eVue.js cannot boast about such features so here React is leading undoubtedly.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e#6. Need a large development mechanism? React is the leader.\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eFor sure, React today is a more popular library that has 2.5 million downloads per month. While Vue library has only 225,000 downloads per month.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3ePopularity is not just a small advantage. It means more discussions, manuals, guides and so on. More add-ons for integration into the project, it saves time and efforts of the developer since he or she can use ready-made solutions.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBoth frameworks are open source, but React was created by Facebook team. This is also a strong side. Companies and developers that prefer React can be confident in the long-term technical support of the library. You can find \x3cstrong\x3eReact.js templates\x3c\/strong\x3e all over the Internet.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eAs for Vue, it was created by one developer whose name is Evan You. He is performing technical support of the library. There are no teams of specialists.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eNevertheless, \x3cstrong\x3eVue popularity\x3c\/strong\x3e is growing, and it constantly shows new updates, and new releases. There are a few thousand open and resolved issues on GitHub.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat is the verdict?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eIn fact, if you use one library in a successful way, there is no sense to change it. To sum up our research, let\x27s list strong sides of both frameworks in a nutshell.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eVue.js pros:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFlexibility when creating templates and rendering;\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSimplicity of syntax and project development; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eA small size of the library and faster integration. \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eAdvantages of React.js:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eBetter for large app development;\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eEasier in testing and learning; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eApplicable for cross-platform development; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eA larger system of add-ons and tools. \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/www.cleveroad.com\/images\/article-previews\/pros-1.png\x22 alt=\x22vuejs reactjs\x22 title=\x22See what pros Vure and React have\x22\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eStrong sides of Vue and React\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cp\x3eBut anyway React and Vue are exclusive UI libraries that have more similarities than differences. Their best features include the following:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eQuick interaction with virtual DOM;\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eNot large size; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eQuickly responding components; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eCan be used on server\x27s part; \x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSimple sync to the router, simple management of conditions.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n          \n"
